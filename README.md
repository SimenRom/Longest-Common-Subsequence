# Longest-Common-Subsequence
This is an algorithm for finding the LCS for two strings. It got two implementations implemented in two different ways:
* Recursive (slow on long strings)
* Dynamic Programming (fast on any length)

Run Sammmenligne.java to compare 50 calculations for both methods. 
Total time and average will be printed to console.
